# Class Methods

## AKA ``static``

* You don't need to create an instance to call ``Class`` (static) methods
* The instance of the ``Class`` is created when the bytecode is loaded by the ``ClassLoader``
* ``Math.min(a,b);``
* Our app is started when ``main`` is called
* Explore [``Math``](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html)

##Exercise
* __EXERCISE:__ Use ``mvn archetype:generate`` and select ``maven-archetype-quickstart`` to generate and app template. In your ``App`` class use a loop and the Math library to print out a table with the radius, the area and the circumference of 10 circles with each radius between  ``1`` and ``10`` units. Instead of printing the values out directly, write a ``class`` method called ``getCircleInfo()`` on your application class which takes an ``array`` of radii (type ``double[n]``) and returns a 2 dimensional array ``double[n][3]``, where in each row of the array the 0th element contains the radius, 1st the area, 2nd the circumference.
* __EXERCISE:__ Replace the AppTest generated by the template with this AppTest Class to your Application. Try it out, by running the tests as a JUnit 4 Unit Test Case in eclipse. (The archetype template uses JUnit 3 syntax, so we are upgrading!)

```
package com.skillbox.boxes.circles;
// You'll need to change this package declaration, eclipse will help!

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class AppTest {
	@Test
	public void testCirclrInfoResultLength() {
		double[] radii = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
		assertEquals(radii.length, CircleApp.getCircleInfo(radii).length);
	}
}
```
