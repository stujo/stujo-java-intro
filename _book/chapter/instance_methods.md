# Instance Methods

* If you have an Object Reference to an ``instanceof`` a ``Class`` you can call it's instance methods
* ``String myString = "Contents of String";``
* ``myString.contains(" of ");``
* Explore [``String``](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)
* How can you change a value of a ``String``?
* __EXERCISE:__ Use ``mvn archetype:generate`` and select ``maven-archetype-quickstart`` to generate and app template. In your ``App`` class write a class method called ``reverseUpperCase`` which takes a ``String`` parameter and uses some instance methods of the String class to return its contents in reversed UPPERCASE as a new ``String``. Call your ``reverseUpperCase`` method 5 times from your main method with some different arguments including "" and print out the results
* __EXERCISE:__ Add a Test!
