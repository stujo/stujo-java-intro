###Exercise
* __EXERCISE:__ Write an application called ``HighRoller`` which utilizes one of these loop types to count the number of dice rolls required to reach ``25``. Each dice roll is a random number between ``1`` and ``6`` inclusive. At the end, print out, the total score and how many rolls it took. If the player rolls exactly ``25`` then print out the special message ``YOU ARE A HIGH ROLLER!!!``
