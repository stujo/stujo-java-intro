# for each - loop

* [for each](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/language/foreach.html)

* Works for arrays and collections


###Exercise
* __EXERCISE:__ Rewrite one (but which one?) of the loops in ``RandomArrayer`` to use the for each loop syntax


* __BONUS:__ (Iterable<E> ``interface``). For each can also iterate over anything that implements the Iterable<E> interface (must define iterator() method). Many of the Collections classes (eg, ArrayList) implement Iterable<E>, which makes the for-each loop very useful. You can also implement Iterable<E> for your own data structures.
