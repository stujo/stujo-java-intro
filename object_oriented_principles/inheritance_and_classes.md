# Inheritance and Classes

* What would a possible hierarchy be for Shape instead of using the mType field?

###Exercise
* Implement the Shape hierarchy discussed

###Bonus Exercise (if we have time)
* Not coding, just on paper
* __BONUS EXERCISE:__ Group discussion, select and brainstorm on domain
* __BONUS EXERCISE:__ Now on your own in groups of two. Pick a domain and make some notes:
 * Describe Domain (package name)
 * Find Classes (``class``)
 * Find Inheritance (``extends``)
 * Draft up classes on paper
* __DISCUSSION:__ Review of examples
