# Abstraction, Encapsulation and Interfaces

When you turn the steering wheel, the front wheels turn, you don't care how it works

* Abstraction (Interface / Observable Behaviour / Exposed)
* Encapsulation (Implementation / Hidden)
* 'The way you use it' is well defined
 * ``interface`` or ``class`` definition
* Clearly defined interfaces allow _Polymorphism..._

* Look back at ``Shape``:
  * we have circles, squares and equilateral triangles
  * consider what it's interface could be, the possible abstraction of a shape
  * What can be encapsulated in the Shape

* __CHECKPOINT:__ Abstraction
