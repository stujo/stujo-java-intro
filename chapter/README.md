##Looking Back at RandomArrayer (TDD)
###Exercise
Use Test Driven Development to help you with these refactoring tasks:
* __EXERCISE:__ Refactor the 'print out array' loop of ``RandomArrayer`` into a separate function - what would be a good return type/value?
* __EXERCISE:__ Refactor the 'sorting' statement ``RandomArrayer`` into a separate function - what would be a good return type/value?
