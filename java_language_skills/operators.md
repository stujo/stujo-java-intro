# Operators

Eclipse will show warnings and errors as you type, pay attention to them to learn how to use these operators

###The Arithmetic Operators
* __EXERCISE:__ Create a new folder called ``operators`` with a class called ``OperatorsApp`` in an appropriate package. For each of the Arithmetic operators ``+``,``-``,``/``,``%``,``++``,``--`` write an example usage and print out the results. Ensure that your app describes the difference between prefix and postfix ``--/++``.

###The Equality and Relational Operators
* __EXERCISE:__ Create a new app any way you wish. In the main method, write an example expression for each of these operators which prints something out:
 * ==      equal to
 * !=      not equal to
 * &gt;       greater than
 * &gt;=      greater than or equal to
 * <       less than
 * <=      less than or equal to
What data type do these expressions return?
