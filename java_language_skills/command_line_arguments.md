# Command Line Arguments

##Command Line Arguments (Java Language)
Enough hard coding! Let's read in some arguments

* ``public static void main(String[] args)``
* How can we access args?

###Exercise
* __EXERCISE:__ Write a simple application in ``sorter`` which takes multiple command line arguments, puts them into an array, sorts the array and prints out the sorted array

###Checkpoint
* __CHECKPOINT:__ Arrays

###Converting Values
* __DEMO:__ Parsing Strings into primitive Types
* __EXERCISE:__ Write a simple application in ``cladder`` which takes two command line arguments, checks that they are present, converts them into double values, multiplies them together and prints out the answer to two decimal places.
