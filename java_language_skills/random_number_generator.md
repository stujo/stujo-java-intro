# Random Number Generator

This code is used in the next examples, we'll learn what all the pieces do later, for now just use this code in your exercises

```
Random random = new java.util.Random();
int randomIntBetween0and99 = random.nextInt(100);
/*
nextInt(int n)
Returns a pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value between 0 (inclusive) and the specified value (exclusive), drawn from this random number generator's sequence.
