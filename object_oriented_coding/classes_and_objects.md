# Classes and Objects

If ``Object`` instances are Cookies then ``Class``es are the cookie cutters

* [Overview](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/)
* Class definitions define:
 * How instances must be created and initialized (Constructors, or other creation pattern)
 * What instances can do - behaviour - (their interfaces, instance methods)
 * How they do it - implementation
 * What data they store internally - fields
 * Who can access what
 * Any Class specific data, constants or behaviours (``static``)
